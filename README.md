NOTE:

# debian-install-scripts
These are the debian scripts I use.

# Pre install requirements.
To use this install script you need to create a config.cnf file.
This config file will store your DirectAdmin license key and username.

First create a file and call it config.cnf
Then add the following to the config.cnf file:
```
# DirectAdmin settings
directadmin_setup_license_key="<your DirectAdmin License key here> (Required)"
directadmin_setup_admin_username="<your DirectAdmin admin username here> (Optional)"
directadmin_setup_headless_email="<the email that the login details should be send to (leave empty for login details on terminal)> (Optional)"
directadmin_custom_config_ns="<set to 1 to enable> (Optional)"
directadmin_custom_config_mysql="<set to 1 to enable> (Optional)"
directadmin_custom_config_ftp="<set to 1 to enable> (Optional)"
```
After that keep note of the file location as you wu=ill need to copy this file into the cloned repository.

# Install DirectAdmin command

```
